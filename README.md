# commonform-render-server

very simple JSON-over-HTTP-post wrapper around a few [Common Form](https://github.com/commonform) rendering libraries

See [`request.schema.json`](./request.schema.json) for the format of JSON POST requests, and the test suite for some examples.

The action is in [`./index.js`](./index.js), the HTTP request handler.
